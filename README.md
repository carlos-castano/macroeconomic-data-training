# MacroEconomics Fallacies

Welcome to the MacroEconomics Fallacies repository! This project aims to illuminate common misconceptions in the field of macroeconomics through an informative HTML file named `index.html`. The goal is to help readers recognize these fallacies and gain a better understanding of the subject.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any data-driven project. In the `preprocessing.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, you will find the techniques used for data preprocessing.

### 2. Data Sources
- All the data used in this project is sourced from official and reputable sources. Detailed information about these sources can be found in the last section of the `index.html` file.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Visualizing data is an essential aspect of data analysis. Check out the `plots.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to see how the data has been visualized.

## Motivation
The main goal of this project is to publish my first GitHub repository, gain hands-on experience in real-world data transformation, learn how to use libraries for data visualization, and apply my skills as a second-year Data Science student in a practical context. 

## Files
You will find Jupyter Notebook files in English, along with the main document written in Spanish.
